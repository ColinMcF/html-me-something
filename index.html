<h1>The people You'll meet in dota 2 ranked</h1>

<h2>The Herald</h2>
<p>The herald is the first one we'll meet. Not the nicest one  to see, but the first you will greet.He'll last pick techies and you'll forget he's in the game. He'll absolutely nothing and call his team lame.</p>
<h2>The Guardian</h2>
<p>The guardian is the next one you will encounter. He'll first pick alchemist and instantly get countered. You will have to stall out the game cause his farm is slow. Then he will join the push, just so he can throw.</p>
<h2>Crusader</h2>

<p>Next is the crusader with his ping from montana. You know he'll pick legion cause he has the arcana. He'll piss off to the jungle and leave bot to the bane. He'll then call the team noobs for losing the lane.</p>

<h2>Archon</h2>

<p>I'll introduce you to the archon since it seems you haven't fleed. He'll never play support, and his picks are full of greed. He'll play viper vs pudge and go 0/9. "I was screwed by lag" is what he will whine.</p>

<h2>Legend</h2>

<p>If you're meeting the legend, then rising up hot. But this one's lack of skills make him stand out like rot. He'll miss every last hit then complained he was screwed. You think he might be boosted but to say so would be rude.</p>

<h2>Ancient</h2>

<p>So you meet the ancient as you rise the ranks with speed. He'll instapick invoker and type "mid or feed" . Throughout the game he will groan and moan. You might win the game, how will never be known</p>

<h2>Divine</h2>

<p>Ah, at last you meet the divine. To witness it's greatness, glory and shine. He'll be with you as a team with a goal to work towards, to top it all off he'll even buy wards.</p>

<h2>Afterwards</h2>

<p>So you have made it to the top with swiftness and agility. Congratulations to reaching dota nobility. You made it all on your own and to your credit, you've finally gained the ability to give advice onto reddit.</p>
